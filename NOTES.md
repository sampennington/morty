# Morty Express Challenge - Analysis Notes

## Key Findings

### The Purge Planet (Planet 2)
- **Frequency: ~200 trip cycle confirmed**
- Pattern: ~100 trips HIGH zone (60-100% success) followed by ~100 trips LOW zone (0-30% success)
- **Each episode starts at RANDOM phase in the cycle**
- Critical: Must detect phase quickly (<15 trips) to exploit effectively

### "On a Cob" Planet (Planet 0)
- Status: Assumed stable ~50%, needs verification
- TODO: Collect focused data to detect any temporal patterns

### Cronenberg World (Planet 1)
- Status: Assumed stable ~50%, needs verification
- TODO: Collect focused data to detect any temporal patterns

## Next Steps
1. Collect massive data for "On a Cob" Planet
2. Collect massive data for Cronenberg World
3. Look for:
   - Temporal patterns/cycles
   - Relationships between planets (do they share phase offsets?)
   - Optimal multi-planet strategy
